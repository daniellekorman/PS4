# Fix the data:
# All of the names of winners and runners up are repeated twice
# Both Margin columns (% and total) have repeat/messy numbers
# First, try to separate the Winners' names into Last, First [Middle] and First [Middle] Last
# Looked up how to split strings where a lowercase letter precedes immediately (no space) an
# uppercase, will also apply that to periods where needed for middle initials
strsplit(elect_table$Winner, split="(?<=([a-z]))(?=[A-Z])", perl=TRUE)
# Was not able to figure out how to split between a period and capital letter, or
# deal with William McKinley.  Since we are just plotting the data, I guess all that isn't necessary
# So, I won't actually delete the redundant strings here.  I spent a long time trying

# Now, deal with the redundant and messy Margin columns
# In the Percentage one, I have to remove everything before the "-" or after "%"

# Change "Margin of Popular Vote (%)" column to character
fixthis <- as.character(elect_table$`Margin of Popular Vote (%)`)
# Get rid of everything before negative, and percentages so it can be a numeric

#This fixes rows 1-4, for 5-29, remove % and delete everything after the first % to get rid of repeat
elect_table$`Margin of Popular Vote (%)`[5:29] <- as.numeric(gsub("%.*", "", fixthis[5:29]))
# Get rid of % for the rest of the column
elect_table$`Margin of Popular Vote (%)`[30:48] <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", fixthis[30:48]))

# Also get rid of % for Popular Vote (%) and Turnout
elect_table$`Popular Vote (%)` <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", as.character(elect_table$`Popular Vote (%)`)))
elect_table$`Turnout (%)` <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", as.character(elect_table$`Turnout (%)`)))
